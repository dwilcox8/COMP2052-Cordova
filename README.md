# COMP2052-Cordova-Accelerometer-Assignment

This is the final assignment for COMP2052 at BCIT. 

The goal of this assignment was to replicate a native Android app through the Cordova platform by demontrating the capabilities of native device features, such as the accelerometer sensor. 

All code is written in the `www/index.html` file and this project includes three Cordova plugins:

* cordova-plugin-device-motion - for the accelerometer
* cordova-plugin-screen-orientation - to keep the screen fixed in portrait mode
* cordova-plugin-whitelist - so Cordova can be used through Android's WebView widget

I have also included the apk (current build) to test and play with.

The APK file is under `platforms/android/build/outputs/apk`.
